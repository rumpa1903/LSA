Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs
 for Linux and Unix.

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, 
stable and fast file and print services for all clients 
using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of 
DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

install samba
In /home/kali make  samba_shared directory
/home/kali/samba_shared me touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
cd /etc/samba
ls /etc/samba
cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp (for backup)
sudo nano smb.conf
delete all thing inside smb.conf and then write:
